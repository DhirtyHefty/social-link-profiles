## my process
I started with the html then i moved to the css.
with the css, i tookk it step by step.
 started with the profile picture. then i move to the links
 i added the colors too during the process(i ddnt finish before adding the colors)


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

## what i learnt
so with centering the items, i used text-align: center
but i changed it later on and i used display: flex

### Continued development

definitely will improve overall . i am slowly getting comfortable.
but i think the main focus will be ths css flexbox?
